# Objective:

The objective of this lab is to cover the following pointers:

1. The importance of naming conventions.
2. The importance of good structure.
3. To understand the importance of concepts like async, await, fetch -- which were covered in module 3.
4. To understand how to use console and manipulate data from an external api, and then display the required fields from that data on the website.

The purpose of this lab is just to cover the above pointers - this lab will not be targeting pointers like:

1. how to make a full blown website.
2. how to design a page or which design is better. ( although some part of this lab will require you to use CSS for designing - but this time
the design will be given ).

Task:

Using ![this link](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/categories.php) your task is to construct a webpage as shown below.

#### Note: you need not be accurate with colors or margin -- but the structure of the website must be same.
